Linux Fundamentals Automation Scripts

This project contains a collection of shell scripts designed to demonstrate core Linux system administration skills. 
Each script automates a specific set of tasks, including file system navigation, file and directory operations, permission 
and ownership management, user account creation and modification, and link handling (hard and soft links). 
The final script focuses on package installation using apt, including tools like tree and gcloud CLI. 
Together, these scripts provide hands-on practice for essential Linux command-line concepts.
